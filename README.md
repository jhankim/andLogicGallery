# andLogicGallery
jQuery powered gallery implementation to showcase the use case of searching UGC by boolean logic. Filtering is done on the client-side rather than on the API level (API doesn't support boolean filtering logic).

You can see the gallery hosted by Github Pages here: http://jhankim.github.io/andLogicGallery/
